2. **Add** the folder to your `resources` directory of your FXServer
3. **Ensure** `jd-library` in your `server.cfg` before other resources that use it:
   ```
   ensure jd-library
   ensure your-script-name
   ```
4. **Add** `"@jd-library/init.lua"` to `shared_scripts` in the `fxmanifest.lua` file of any script that uses jd-library:
   ```lua
   shared_script '@jd-library/init.lua'
   ```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Once installed, you can use the library in your scripts:

```lua
-- Events
events:on('playerSpawned', function()
  print('Player spawned!')
end)

-- Players
players:setHp(200)
players:tp({x = 100, y = 200, z = 30})
